Description: Based on real data, the package simulates new metagenomic data 
    by re-sampling real samples and then implants differentially abundant 
    features. Additionally, the package can simulate confounding factors based 
    on metadata variables in the real data. The simulations are stored in an 
    `.h5` file, which is then the basis for downstream benchmarking, 
    involving i) reality assessment of the  simulations, ii) testing for 
    differential abundance, and iii) evaluation of the output from 
    differential abundance testing methods.
